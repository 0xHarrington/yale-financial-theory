This repo holds the collection of programs I made while following along with the [Yale - Financial Theory with John Geanakoplos][https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlwF7ocKStyTYSJhIntn2uaU5Yaf9E6Ij] playlist on YouTube. Professor Geanakoplos's course, ECON 251, covers:

- Standard no-arbitrage finance
  - Theoretically
  - Practically, from Prof. Geanakoplos's hedge fund perspective
- The mortgage market and the crisis
- The leverage cycle
- The mathematical logic of the invisible hand and why regulation is needed with incomplete markets
- Social Security
